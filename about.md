# About

## Why the name "Pr1malbyt3s"? 
Well, when I initially broke into Information Security (InfoSec), I felt like (and still often do) a caveman. I have always been a fan of being really proficient at the basics and foundations, especially before moving into advanced techniques and technologies. All that being said, I wanted to create a personal, accurate adage that captures both my Paleolithic attitude of simple first (Primal) and a digital component of all information we face in security (bytes). Frankly, I would have rolled with Primalbytes if the domain wasn't already registered. So I did the next best thing and used l33t translation (maybe not depending on who you ask) to transform Primalbytes into the much, much cooler Pr1malbyt3s. Thanks for agreeing.
  
## What's with the wolf?
Wolves have been around since the inception of what I consider our most primal era as humans. Not only are wolves representative of the primal theme, but they are also an icon of persisting with constantly changing environments, which I strive to do as a professional. Most importantly, the wolf is bottom line a badass animal and also the mascot of my alma mater.
