# Welcome to Pr1malbyt3s! 
This site's intended use is mine and others' educational benefit in the domain of Information Security. You can find wiki style content for various categories along with periodic blog posts. Just like the journey in education, this site will by no means ever be complete. More content will always be in the works. If you have any suggestions for material or blog posts, I am always open to exploring new ideas and concepts. Additionally, if you have any criticism, discussion points, or questions, please reach out at anytime. Enjoy!
